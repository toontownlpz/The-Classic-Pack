**The Classic Pack** is a content pack for ***[Toontown Rewritten](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/)*** designed to restore the visual irregularities, disappointments and confusion brought onto our childhood selves by our favorite computer game, *[Disney's Toontown Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online)*. Boring holiday events, super-sonic Toon running, and skinnier Sellbot Skelecogs galore!

## At the moment, the pack does the following...
- Adds the iconic Toontown Online clouds to the game's initial loading screen and splash screen
- Replaces the Toontown Rewritten branding with its BETA counterpart
- Re-introduces an edited version of the original Pick-a-Toon background (Thanks, [Sarah/RynoGG](https://twitter.com/_rynogg)!)
- Hides all holiday-themed splash screens and Pick-a-Toon screens
- Introduces a recreation of the old Battle UI from prior to the Sellbot Task Force update (Thanks, [/u/King0654](https://www.reddit.com/r/toontownrewritten/comments/1269hof/the_nostalgia_pack_v3_old_toontown_content_pack/)!)

<b>Note:</b> Since Toontown Rewritten does not allow replacing models using content packs, the festive texture attached to the Bugle gag model cannot be removed. Sorry for the inconvenience!

**Note: This content pack does not specifically aim to remove or change features introduced by the *Toontown Rewritten* team, but rather restore what was changed when the game was given some love by the wonderful folks on their team. I will naturally flip-flop on this stance where I see fit. There may be some changes you disagree with in this content pack, but you are welcome to strike up a discussion with me over on Discord @ [robertfwallis](https://discord.com/users/107224459018006528) if you have any proposals. Alternatively, feel free to fork this pack and create your own pull requests!**
