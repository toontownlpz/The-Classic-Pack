**The Classic Pack** is a content pack for ***[Toontown Rewritten](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/)*** designed to restore the visual irregularities, disappointments and confusion brought onto our childhood selves by our favorite computer game, *[Disney's Toontown Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online)*. Boring holiday events, super-sonic Toon running, and skinnier Sellbot Skelecogs galore!

## At the moment, the pack does the following...
- Adds the iconic Toontown Online clouds to the game's initial loading screen and splash screen
- Replaces the Toontown Rewritten branding with its BETA counterpart, also hiding the 10th Anniversary logos

- Hides all holiday-themed splash screens and Pick-a-Toon screens

<b>Note:</b> Since Toontown Rewritten does not allow replacing models using content packs, the festive texture attached to the Bugle gag model cannot be removed. Sorry for the inconvenience!

**Note: This content pack does not specifically aim to remove or change features introduced by the *Toontown Rewritten* team, but rather restore what was changed when the game was given some love by the wonderful folks on their team. I will naturally flip-flop on this stance where I see fit. There may be some changes you disagree with in this content pack, but you are welcome to strike up a discussion with me over on Discord @ [toontownlpz](https://discord.com/users/107224459018006528) if you have any proposals. Alternatively, feel free to fork this pack and create your own pull requests!**

For the most authentic experience, adjust the game's video settings to match the following:
 - <b>V-Sync</b> ➜ Enabled
 - <b>Antialiasing</b> ➜ Off
 - <b>Anisotropic Filtering</b> ➜ Off
 - <b>LOD Distance</b> ➜ Near
 - <b>Font Quality</b> ➜ Classic
 - <b>Animation Blending</b> ➜ Disabled
 - <b>GUI Animation</b> ➜ Disabled
 - <b>Animation Smoothing</b> ➜ Disabled

<b>UPDATE:</b> As of December 5th, 2023, Toontown Rewritten has introduced an unsupported/experimental aspect ratio option. You can find it by opening the [settings.json](https://toontownrewritten.wiki/Settings.json) file in a text editor, and navigating to the `"video"` section. Simply changing the value of `"forced-aspect-ratio":` from `0.0` to `1.3333333` creates the infamously dubbed "4:3 aspect ratio lock" Toontown Online was known for.
